Controlling a servo on the drone is not an uncommon feature that many drone hobbyists want for their setup. To get a servo to be controlled through the PWM signals output from the FCU, a little configuration must be done on the firmware side. First, an appropriate airframe must be specified with a mixer file with the proper PWM channels configured as seen [here](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/concept/mixing.html). For a quadcopter, 4 main channels are already used. Thus, an additional channel must be configured for the servo. Note, for a Pixhawk 4 mini, the channels must be configured on the MAIN ports (The Pixhawk 4 mini does not have any AUX ports due to its small size).

Once the mixer file is updated, the servo can be sent PWM signals. However, it still needs power! The 4 main motors on the quadcopter are powered externally from a 12V line supplied by a PDB. Since the servo uses a 5V line, a UBEC is typically used to obtain an appropriate power line for it. Once the PWM minimum and maximum signals are sent for the appropriate angles of the servo, it can now be controlled via the Pixhawk interface.
