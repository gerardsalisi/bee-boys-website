FPV cameras usually have displays to give additional information to the user. However, when a FPV camera is connected to a Pixhawk controller, it expects a heartbeat to make sure the camera is constantly communicating. If a heartbeat isn’t given, the following interface is shown:

This wouldn’t be a problem for manual control but the text overlay causes problems when applying computer vision to the image. The OSD can be removed/configured by properly connecting the camera to the FCU. The [Pixhawk 4 mini](https://docs.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/flight_controller/pixhawk4_mini.html)  has a different interface due to its minimal design. With some troubleshooting, the team was able to properly connect the camera to obtain a more minimal interface. Here is our software expert Justin setting up the OSD interface to display metadata about the drone.
