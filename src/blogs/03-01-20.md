Throughout the testing of the drone, it was noticed that the many rough landings had caused the connection for the camera to the FCU to be damaged. The first step taken was to try fixing the wiring through using other available wires and soldering them together. However, upon doing so, the video feed became no longer usable. The second step was soldering the backup camera previously used for testing in place of the original camera. However, upon boot up, the backup camera quickly smoked up. 

With little time to order new components, our team went in search of hobby stores for replacement parts. This led to a RC store in Kitchener that had a new video transmitter and camera. After the final replacement process, the video feed was restored; however, since the new components do not sync with the FCU, the OSD no longer appears. Nonetheless, what appeared to be a major setback was able to be resolved.
