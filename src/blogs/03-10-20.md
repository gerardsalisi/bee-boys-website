During testing a few days ago, a crash landing resulted in the destruction of the ESCs on the drone. Consequently, we were unable to perform our demo with our original drone flying, but the spare Parrot drone mentioned earlier came in handy for that. 

The added trouble is that these damaged ESCs have specific “bullet” connectors that interface to the motors. These connectors are brilliant for quick disconnects, but unfortunately it seems only HolyBro is using this, and to get a replacement would probably take 1-2 weeks at least (economic shipping from China). 

Today the group is driving to Paris Ontario to buy a new set of 4 replacement ESCs. Hopefully soldering them later in the evening and then if all goes well we should see our original drone up and flying.

The group arrived from Paris, successfully acquiring the appropriate ESCs. Brynn was able to solder them to the drone and calibrate them for flight testing.
