Due to the poor weather outside, the team thought it would be difficult to restrict flight tests to outdoor environments only. We tried an indoor test, but because of the poor GPS signals indoors, there was a large amount of drift. The drift took the pilot by surprise, and as a result, the drone crashed into the wall. Upon inspection, one propeller broke, and the other ones were scratched.  Luckily, the drone came with multiple spare propellers.
