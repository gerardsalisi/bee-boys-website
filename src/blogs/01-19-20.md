At the beginning of the week, the team discussed their progress with the advisors. A basic update of the project was given and the advisors suggested finding a space for the drone to be flown in during the demo. The group was advised to talk to Eugene Li and some various labs within the university. 

Throughout the week, the drone was continously worked on. The video transmitter from the drone was working but there were issues with receiving telemtry data from the drone. The drone company was contacted to see if the issue could be troubleshooted. Extra parts were also ordered such as the radio controller and an extra camera. 

An image from the drone can be seen below with our drone expert, Brynn.
