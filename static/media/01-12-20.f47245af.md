Over the break, the group ordered all the parts necessary to build the drone. The assembly was scheduled earlier in the week but some cables were missing to completely test the drone. A XT60 cable was ordered to charge the drone and should be coming next week. As the next step, the general schedule and project was planned. The entire project and their corresponding milestones can be viewed on Github [here](https://github.com/jwang61/Bee-Boys/projects/2).

The group discussed different implementations for the pollination mechanism. The following is an image of the pollination mount to the drone.
