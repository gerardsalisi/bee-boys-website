## Simulation 

Because of the serious crash and the time it would take to obtain parts and repair, it was decided to put in further work into the software development using simulation tools. To do this, a picture of a flower was taken and placed into the simulator, and the simulated drone was modified so that it also returns a video feed. With this, we were able to visualize the drone flying to the flower's location, as shown in the video.

## AR Drone 2.0
While the drone was still being repaired, our team was able to get our hands on a Parrot AR Drone 2.0, thanks to Professor Azad and his research lab. While there were some differences in the operation of the AR Drone, it was not difficult to quickly port our software over. With that, we were able to perform live testing of our software!

The results are spotty but it does succeed from time to time. We suspect the main source of failure is within the new camera. The previous camera had a fisheye lens, allowing for a much larger (albeit distorted PoV); the newer camera on the Parrot does not use a fisheye lense, consequently it loses sight of the flower itâ€™s tracking much quicker.
