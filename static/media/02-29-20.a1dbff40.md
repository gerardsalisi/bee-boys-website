For offboard control of the drone, research was put into the different ROS topics that the controller subscribes to. These topics corresponded to different types of drone control methods:

* The first control method is through sending pose messages. This process would require reading pose measurements on the drone and sending relative positions. However, because the pose measurements of the drone were not very accurate, this approach was not taken.

* Another control method was through the use of attitude, which is angular velocity input. This method is useful because it does not require the current position; however, it was dangerous, as commands that change roll and pitch could lead to unpredictable flying.
* The last method was through the use of linear velocity commands. This was the method selected.

In summary, after capturing video feed and performing processing, velocities were outputted to the drone as control to move it towards flowers.
