As can be seen from the last blog post, the camera feed has a lot of distortion. This is because drone cameras typically want a very large field of view, and thus rely on fish lens. This distortion makes it difficult to approximate distance of objects in the camera image, so calibration is usually performed to transform the camera image.

There are existing softwares online for performing camera calibration. This usually involves printing a pattern and taking images at different angles of the pattern with the camera. Below is an example of such images. After capturing, the distortion visible from each image can be used to compute the necessary transforms required to undistort the video feed.
