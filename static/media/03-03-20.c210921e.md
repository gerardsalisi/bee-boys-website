Test 1: Manual flying + equipment check
We have to ensure that when flying manually, the servo will stay stationary and not actuate into the board. In addition, we are checking the signal to see the video feed. During this test, we realized we needed to change the max pwm setting.

Test 2: Offboard hover + equipment check
In our second test while the drone is hovering, we are sending zero velocity and actuating the servo and checking video feed.

Unfortunately, our test 2 resulted in a severe crash. This resulted in our ESCs burning out:

Since the group is unable to fly the drone, it was decided that we would continue software development through simulation.
