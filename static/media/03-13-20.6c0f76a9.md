Now that the drone was fixed, the group was able to fix some software issues and create a working demo:

In this video, the drone is piloted such that it has the flower in its field of view. Then it switches to autonomous mode and attempts to pollinate the flower. In this demo, the drone misses the first time but is able to pollinate the flower on the second attempt.
